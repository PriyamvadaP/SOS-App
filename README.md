**Smart Streets: IOT based quick emergency alerting system**

In the recent years, Safer movement of people, especially the women and the elderly, in
the night or even in the day time, in streets or roads has been a critical issue.
The safety of people during the travel is very important and it is obviously the
responsibility of each and every citizen too ensure that we provide a safe environment
to our fellow people.
Emergency situations can occur with anybody and anywhere. The phone can play a
very important role in such situations. In case of emergencies, the user may not
have enough time to dial for the emergency number, his family, friends or a hospital.

This project intends to develope an
emergency alerting system that will activate the alarms installed on the street lights and
the traffic lights, in the vicinity of the victim only, when the victim simply activates the
SOS button on the cell phones.
The proposed system will alert the people in that locality that there is a case of
emergency as buzzer emits sound as well emergency alert notification is sent to their
contact list, with the help of firebase which is integrating with ESP-32 and Arduino IDE
software.


The SOS app developed is capable of storing the emergency contacts of the user and
sending the last known coordinates of the user.

The screenshots depicts the working of the SOS app in the User’s phone ,shows the
warning message and the coordinates of the User in the Emergency contact’s phone.
